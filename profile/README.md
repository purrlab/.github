## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the PURRlab Github!

This is a collection of repositories related to projects done by people within the lab, at ITU Copenhagen (from 2021) or TU Eindhoven (2017-2020).

The repositories are forked from their original owners and not usually updated, to see the latest work from each repository, please refer to the original.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
